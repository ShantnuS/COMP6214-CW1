Just by seeing:
	1. Some cells had values shifted by one column. This was easy to see because there were empty cells in the beginning part of the row.
		1.1. Countries which had this issue included UK, Italy, India, Ecuador, Chile (one also missing country code), Australia.

	1. Lots of empty rows found, e.g. 479, 536, 591, 692, etc. 
		1.1. Easy fix in Excel by selecting all data then "Data" > "Filter". Now select the first column and filter only blank items. Delete all the items here which are completely empty.



STUFF I MIGHT FIND:
	1. Different names for same entry (i.e. UK and GB)
	2. Duplicate entries 
	3. Out of date entries (e.g. Rhodesia) 
	4. Rows in incorrect format (Total Production) 
	5. Vandalism (netflix and chile)
